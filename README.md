# tuulihelve-portfolio

This project is a static portfolio site for Visual Artist Tuuli Helve, created using only HTML and CSS, according to her wishes.

The actual site contains very little text, so I tried to add comprehensive alternative text to make it at least a bit more usable for screen readers etc.
